# IS 310 ProposalBy Dharra Prashaad, John Gadomski, and Nate Gomez**Framing the Project**- Introduce your selected topic      - Explain the rationale for your selection	  - While discussing topics, we bounced around a couple of different ideas that related to gendered language in fictional novels. We needed a more narrow scope to focus on, and we thought romance novels would give us great insight on comparing gendered language usage between males and females. We were unsure of whether to analyze the gender of the characters on top of the genders of the authors, and moving forward we are going to focus on authors, but incorporate anything we learn about the genders of the characters, if possible    - Describe your interests in the project and previous experience (if anything) with the subject area        - The class’s Project Gutenberg activity gave us new insight on how we should approach our analysis of novels (LeBlanc)        - BenSchmidt.org is a great resource that inspired us to base our project around gendered language (“Gendered Language…”)        - Our group has some knowledge with web scraping, very little experience specifically with web scraping books    - List and explain relevant outside resources and projects that you plan to use as a reference or example        - In order to avoid any biases in the extrapolation of our data, we chose not to look at certain best sellers lists. These lists sometimes promote certain books/authors for profit, so we chose to use the RNA award list that dates back to 1960 (Romance Novel of the Year Award) (“Awards”). This list will be less biased than Amazon's or New York Times' best-selling list.    - Cite and discuss any relevant course readings or outside sources that have shaped how you are thinking about this topic        - Inspired by Ben Schmidt's analysis of gendered word usage in RateMyProfessor.com reviews, as mentioned before, was the main inspiration for our project (“Gendered Language…”)        - Pudding.cool articles have given inspiration for the visual aspect of our project (“The Pudding”)**Proposed Methodology**- Detail how you plan to approach working on this topic    - We plan on being adaptable because we may face unforeseen barriers or issues. We would like to see if an author’s gender impacts the adjectives they use in romance novels, so we will be accessing a romance awards list and using the winners from every other year from 1960 to 2018. We will attempt to use the top ten adjectives from the year the book won the award and see how many of those adjectives were used in the novel as well as see how often they were used. We also plan to visualize the data we find using graphs and charts.- if you are building a resource (in our class that’s primarily a website), explain your approach for both creating your resource and curating data    - We will attempt to use Figma.com (the free plan) to visualize the data we find and present our experiences when finding, curating, and analyzing the data (“The Collaborative…”). We would also like to offer access to our code on the site. Figma.com makes creating online graphs or charts easy and interactive. It also allows for multiple collaborators, which makes it especially useful for this group project. Ideally, we would like to showcase the most popular adjectives overall, the most popular adjectives depending on the author’s gender (we do not mean to present a gender binary so we may have to include options that portray non-binary or genderfluid genders that have no data due to the potential lack of gender diversity of the authors), and the most popular adjectives per year offered (so every even year since 1960 except 2020 and 2022).- if you are asking a research question (i.e. taking a more data-driven approach), explain how you plan to turn your topic into a question that can be answered with data    - Our question is: Does the given gender of romance authors who have won the Romantic Novelists' Association main award affect adjective choice? Luckily, we were already wondering about gender and language before we created our topic, so aspects research question came first. Once we did research on which authors to look into and what parts of their language we wanted to analyze, we were able to add specifications to the research question. This question can be answered by data as numerical quantities of specific adjectives used within the novel plus the information on the authors’ proposed genders will answer the question.    - We would ideally like to demonstrate how language is affected by gender and reveal that through coding. Our audience is entry-level coders, people interested in the intersection of coding and humanities, or just readers who want more information on the novels they are consuming. Our research draws upon Ben Schmidt’s research into the gendered language in teaching reviews but looks into the other side of gendered language–rather than researching how the gender of the subject affects language, we are looking into how the gender of the writer affects language (“Gendered Language…”).- Detail how you will get data for this project. Do you have access to existing data? Or do you need to collect data?    - Specifically, we'll be looking at the Romantic Novelists' Association's main award winners from every other year between 1960 to 2018 and accessing the books. We will analyze the language in the books and search for common adjectives used in the books (“Awards”). We will look for the top adjectives of a year if possible and see if they correspond to the novels but we will also include an overall adjective list to have a stable comparison across all the novels. We will need to access existing data (the books and the adjectives) and will do so by downloading the text files of the books. Additionally, the authors’ proposed genders also exist, so we will just need to do some research into the authors to access that.- Explain what methods you think you will use and why    - We will search through Project Gutenburg for the books (if needed, we may have to look elsewhere for the novels but many are old and popular so they should be easy to find), textually analyze them by using code to find common adjectives, find how often those adjectives occur within the books, and use Figma.com to display the data we find. We will also have to create a directory with author information and book information. We will then compare our findings of adjectives to author information and look for correlations between adjectives and gender.**Detailed Work Plan**- List how you plan to breakdown the tasks required to complete the work over the remainder of the semester    - For the rest of the semester, we have decided to break down the workload for this group project into a fairly even task list for the three of us to work on. However, we will still be collaborating as a group and helping each other where it is needed, but the overall workload will be split in terms of who is responsible for the portion they are assigned to. The workload split will be as follows: Dharra will be in charge of finding and obtaining the texts of the novels we will be using in this project, and will also be finding the lists of adjectives as needed, including the top ten adjectives used. Once Dharra has found the texts and adjective list, John will be mainly in charge of the actual scraping and visualization of the data we need, by doing a count within the text on the use of each adjective, as well as using figma.com to present this information as necessary. Nate will essentially be in charge of bringing this information together, by creating a cohesive final presentation taking Dharra and John’s work and putting it together to present the visualized data, where we extracted it from, and how we did it. In addition to that, he will also be taking one last look with John and Dharra at the data and cleaning up any loose ends in preparation for the final presentation.    - In short, the workload will be split as follows:        - Dharra-find books, find adjective list, final data being used        - John-scrape/visualize data        - Nate-final presentation/neatening data- Also include any areas where you need to do further research or unsure about how you will complete the tasks    - Adjective list    - Blog or no blog    - Characters’ genders?# Works Cited“Awards.” *RNA*, Romantic Novelists' Association, 2022, https://romanticnovelistsassociation.org/awards/#1558103531462-a03d3a64-9cff“Gendered Language in Teaching Evaluations.” *Gender and Teacher Reviews*, Ben Schmidt, http://benschmidt.org/profGender.LeBlanc, Prof. Zoe. “Python Advanced Assignments.” *IS 310 Computing in the Humanities*, 7 Mar. 2022, https://zoeleblanc.com/is310-computing-humanities/materials/advanced-python/04-python-assignment.“The Collaborative Interface Design Tool.” *Figma*, Figma, https://www.figma.com/.The Pudding. *The Pudding*, The Pudding, https://pudding.cool/.
